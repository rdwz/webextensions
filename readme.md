# Marnes' WebExtensions

## Deprecation notice

These webextensions have been retired due to their overhead burden (nodejs tooling, CI infrastructure, 2 stores, feature creep from user requests, etc), aging code quality, lack of use to myself, and professionally having outgrown this project.

**I do have a [greasyfork account](https://greasyfork.org/en/users/18593-marnes) and may publish works there in the future.** Copy Selected Links, Image Background Color Picker, and Doubleclick Image Downloader have always had and still have some use to me, and their core functionality should be trivial to implement in barebones userscripts.

## For users

This repository hosts all extensions developed by Marnes (see
[list](./extensions)) in one place. Please report bugs, ask questions, or
request features for any of them here.

Contributions in the form of developer efforts or
[buying me some coffees](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/marnes) are most
appreciated. Feedback — positive words or critical but fair review — is
preferably left on the Firefox/Chrome stores.

My extensions were originally created to suit my own needs, then taken public
for programming practice and to be useful to more people than only me. They are
(and will remain) spare time projects.
